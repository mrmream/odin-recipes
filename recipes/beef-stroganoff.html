    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With its tender chunks of beef coated in a luscious creamy sauce and served over a bed of buttery noodles, it’s no wonder Beef Stroganoff is such a hit. With all that flavor, you might assume it’s a complicated dish, but it’s actually quite the opposite. This from-scratch recipe can be made in well under an hour and with only 20 minutes of hands-on time, since it’s really all about the simmer. (The key to transforming the beef into succulent morsels of mouthwatering meat.) So when you want to impress the family but don’t have all day to do it—this one’s a guaranteed hit!</p>
